minih264
==========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lieff/minih264.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/lieff/minih264)

Small, but yet reasonably fast H264/SVC encoder single-header library with SSE/NEON optimizations.
Decoder can be popped up in future.

Disclaimer: code highly experimental.

## Comparison with [x264](https://www.videolan.org/developers/x264.html)

Rough comparison with x264 on an i7-6700K:

`x264 -I 30 --profile baseline --preset veryfast --tune zerolatency -b 0 -r 1 --qp 33 --ipratio 1.0 --qcomp 1.0 -o x264.264 --fps 30 vectors/foreman.cif --input-res 352x288 --slices 1 --threads 1`

vs

`./h264enc_x86 vectors/foreman.cif`

You can compare results in motion using ffplay/mpv players on vectors/out_ref.264 and vectors/x264.264 .

## Usage

TBD

## SVC

Minih264 supports both spatial and temporal layers. Spatial layers are almost same as encode 2 independent AVC streams except for Intra frames prediction.
Following diagram shows minih264 SVC scheme for two spatial layers:

![SVC diargam](images/svc.png?raw=true)

That's because P frames spatial prediction are almost useless in practice. But for Intra frames there is a ~20% benefit in full resolution frame size.
Note that decoder must have both base layer I frame _and_ full resolution SVC I frame to decode whole sequence of next P frames in full resolution.

## Limitations

The following major features are not supported compared to x264:

 * Trellis quantization.
 * Select prediction mode using Sum of Absolute Transform Differences (SATD).
 * 4x4 motion compensation.
